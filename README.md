# Andrew Bevan: Example of Spatial Analysis and Data Mani[ulaiton Using Iron Age Coins

This repository includes data and R code used in a talk at the Coin Hoarding in the Roman Empire (15 September 2016), University of Oxford.

Note that the spatial data used here has already been moved to an arbitrary grid so will not map correctly in absolute space. 

The workflow discusses (a) loading and mapping spatial data in R, (b) repositioning spatial data to avoid passing on perfectly accurate coordinates, but without degrading precision, and (c) construction of relative risk surfaces from case-control data.
